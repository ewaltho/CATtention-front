## Description
Welcome to CATtention! This app is a productivity tool for people who struggle with ADHD. With utilization of the pomodoro method, award systems, and collaborative encouragement, users can join a focus oriented study room that reinforces good habits with regular breaks and games.

This application was designed for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp Final Project to showcase our understanding of the MERN stack. Our application uses SQL to house user information, react for our UI, and Node/Express to handle our server and routes. In building this application, we have learned the importance of team collaboration and how to learn and grow as full-stack developers.

## Installation
No installation is required! Simply follow this link to our deployed application: [CATtention](https://cattention.netlify.app/).

If you are interested in viewing our backend repository, it can be viewed here: https://github.com/blaubachs/cattention-api.

## Usage
Usage for this app is quite simple. Upon following the link you are greeted with a landing page prompting you to register. After signing up, you can either create a room or join one a friend has made. Once in the room, the timer starts when the button is pressed. While that timer runs, the user is encouraged to work and chat with others if they have questions or need encouragement. Once the timer is up, they are prompted with a cat themed trivia game. Users can level up their profiles by using the app more and can earn cat badges as they level up to make their profile unique. You can work by yourself or with a couple of friends!
